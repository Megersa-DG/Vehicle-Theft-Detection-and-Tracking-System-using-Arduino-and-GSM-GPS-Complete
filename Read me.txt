This GPS Vehicle theft detection system detects the Vehicle theft then 
it activates the Tracking System. Then a text SMS sends to the owner of 
the vehicle using GSM and Arduino.

 
This system theft detects in two ways :
1. If Invalid access to the vehicle ignition key then system treats it as 
vehicle theft and immediately turns on the buzzer periodically and sends 
text SMS(containing location link) to the user using GPS and if the owner 
sends msg 'STOP'  then immediately engine will shut down.

2. If the unknown person has taken the vehicle through the cargo then based 
on the movement of the vehicle using ADXL sensor or a tilt sensor the system 
treats it as a theft and immediately turns on the buzzer and sends text 
SMS(containing location link) to the user using GPS.
